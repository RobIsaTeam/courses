## general
- add fetch polyfill thing to index.html: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fetch
- email about internet for course??!
- reply re resources?
- go through and decide on which challenges to do for campjs

## lesson 1
- information vs activity

## lesson 2
- move the image a bit down
- delete 2nd challenge
(- early challenges... a bit boring?)
- point out which folder to start the live-server from and why

## lesson 3
- include stlloader where we actually start using it.
- challenge: make link a link
- 1st challenge: maybe use a different loader and file and make the challenge to load the monkey brain stl?
- check why the brain is pixellated
- show docs before materials challenge

## lesson 4
- fix 1st challenge - don't set the fov to 20 first, suggest adjusting fov though
- combine 2nd + 3rd challenges - make them get the scene to look a certain way (looking down on the brain)
- "position" typo in 3rd challenge
- change the text (doesn't miraculously look anywhere automatically - just points along x or z axis by default)
- add axes: mention which colour is which axis in the material
- maybe draw 2 diagrams to help with camera position + lookat

## lesson 5
- add hint - make sure the camera position is set to something other than 0,0,0

## lesson 6
- give the challenge a name... add links?...
- note has a weird underscore at the end...
- maybe replace 0x040404 color with word color?
- instead of 3 spheres, make 2 eyes
- advanced challenge: texture o_o - do we need to point them to a texture image file?

## lesson 7
- add safari bit to html for fetch (in lesson and in our examples)
- chain all the things: get rid of '1'
- ../data/ somewhere (one of the code blocks)
- get rid of 1. in scale the sphere challenge
- change counter --> currentIndex in code snippet
- separate line for setInterval
- make the last step of adding the animation the challenge: adding the `currentindex` variable and incrementing / resetting it
- make colour challenge an advanced challenge
- fix indentation in big code block
- move the changing field of view line to early on in the lesson (it's currently quite late)


## lesson 8
