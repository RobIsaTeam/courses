## general
- [x]: add fetch polyfill thing to index.html: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fetch
- [ ]: work out how to host version of everything we need (threejs.org, our notes, d3 API.md, etc.)
- [x]: go through and decide on which challenges to do for campjs

## lesson 1
- [x]: information vs activity

## lesson 2
- [x]: move the image a bit down
- [x]: delete 2nd challenge
- [x]: point out which folder to start the live-server from and why

## lesson 3
- [x]: include stlloader where we actually start using it.
- [x]: challenge: make link a link
- [ ]: (LATER) 1st challenge: maybe use a different loader and file and make the challenge to load the monkey brain stl?
- [x]: show docs before materials challenge (while teaching - not in notes)

## lesson 4
- [x]: fix 1st challenge - don't set the fov to 20 first, suggest adjusting fov though - make a fish eye lens
- [x]: combine 2nd + 3rd challenges - make them get the scene to look a certain way (looking down on the brain)
- [x]: "position" typo in 3rd challenge
- [x]: change the text (doesn't miraculously look anywhere automatically - just points along x or z axis by default)
- [x]: add axes: mention which colour is which axis in the material
- [x]: maybe draw 2 diagrams to help with camera position + lookat

## lesson 5
- [x]: add hint - make sure the camera position is set to something other than 0,0,0

## lesson 6
- [x]: give the challenge a name...
- [x]: note has a weird underscore at the end...
- [ ]: (LATER) maybe replace 0x040404 color with 'grey'
- [x]: instead of 3 spheres, make 2 eyes
- [ ]: (LATER) advanced challenge: texture o_o - do we need to point them to a texture image file?

## lesson 7
- [x]: add safari bit to html for fetch (in lesson and in our examples)
- [x]: chain all the things: get rid of '1'
- [x]: ../data/ somewhere (one of the code blocks)
- [x]: get rid of 1. in scale the sphere challenge
- [x]: change counter --> currentIndex in code snippet
- [x]: separate line for setInterval
- [x]: make the last step of adding the animation the challenge: adding the `currentindex` variable and incrementing / resetting it
- [x]: make colour challenge an advanced challenge
