- [ ] ğŸ¦„: simpler build up for scales (1d first)? maybe?
- [ ] ğŸ¦†+ğŸ¦„: more advanced challenges maybe?

### ThreeJS:
- [x] ğŸ¦†: delete JS intro bits and sort lessons in ascending order
- [ ] ğŸ¦„: swap images 5 and 6 (might be already done)
- [ ] ğŸ¦„: turn off spell checker in keynote before exporting images
- [ ] ğŸ¦„: export images with higher resolution
- [ ] ğŸ¦„: setup flow: color in boxes 
- [ ] ğŸ¦„: setup flow: stack boxes vertically
- [ ] ğŸ¦„: make stimulus images for texture challenge (or video)
- [ ] ğŸ¦„: create data file / trace data from paper
- [ ] ğŸ¦†: interpolate data traces
- [ ] ğŸ¦†: create main.js files
- [ ] ğŸ¦†+ğŸ¦„: review lessons

- [ ] ğŸ¦†: Merge commit history from the 3 repos ([d3-orig](https://github.com/IsaKiko/D3-visualising-data), [threejs-old](https://github.com/RobIsaTeam/ThreeJS-course), [current-repo](https://github.com/RobIsaTeam/courses))
- [ ] ğŸ¦†: **[priority]** See if code (js/css/html/images) for each course can go into a code directory in each course and still load in iframes
- [ ] ğŸ¦„: Fix indentation in code blocks

## ThreeJS Lesson Plan ğŸ¦†+ğŸ¦„:
- lesson 7: animation of sphere sizes
- lesson 8: clicking on spheres with plotly pop-up
- advanced challenge: make stimulus textures on planes thing (lesson 7 or 8)
- advanced challenge: give the brain eye (textured spheres)

## CampJS Notes:

### Things we might want to do differently / explain at CampJS:
- explain how we normally run it (and who it's normally for - web beginners)
- we'll have short parts where we explain something and we would like everyone to keep quiet during this
- in between we'll have longer parts where we will have set a challenge to work on
- but you can also work on your own d3/threejs stuff if you're a bit ahead
- we'll be available to help you during this (giving priority to the people working on the challenge we set) 
- but also please ask and help each other out!
