## CampJS Notes:

### Things we might want to do differently / explain at CampJS:
- explain how we normally run it (and who it's normally for - web beginners)
- we'll have short parts where we explain something and we would like everyone to keep quiet during this
- in between we'll have longer parts where we will have set a challenge to work on
- everything will be in vanilla JS
- but you can also work on your own d3/threejs stuff if you're a bit ahead
- we'll be available to help you during this (giving priority to the people working on the challenge we set)
- but also please ask and help each other out!
